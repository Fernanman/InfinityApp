# InfinityApp

This is an interface and API that I created for the Columbia's CSEE 4119 Computer Networks. The application implements a blockchain currency application where users can buy, sell, and transfer currency.  

## Code Execution Instructions

To use the application, run `python infinityapi.py`. This will start the api for the interface to communicate with. To use the application, open `interface/index.html` in a browser. An account must be registered for use, then you may login to the app. 

## Directory Files Descriptions

- `infinity_bank.py` -- Executes the logic for that the API uses. Stores and manipulate data in a database.
- `infinityapi.py`   -- The api that uses the Infinity Bank for the user interface to communicate with.
